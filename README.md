# The Odin Project -  Sign-up form
This project was made while doing The Odin Project. </br>
The page is a simple styled HTML page with form elements, used to emulate a real sign-up page with required input elements and checks for correct patterns (password written correctly twice, email is email format etc.) The page has HTML checks so that password is minimum 8 lengh, email is email-format. JavaScript is used to check that both password fields match, and that phone number matches a finnish phone number.</br><br>

## Technologies used
**HTML** (form-inputs, input-element validations) </br>
**CSS** (styling, img+form side, flexbox, hover-effects, button colors, fonts)</br>
**JavaScript** (additional form-validation)</br></br>

## What I learned
I did a basic sign-up page with form-elements, CSS-styling and JavaScript. I refreshed my skills on forms as I have used them before and got better at doing UI for a simple register page.
